# Data Science Portfolio

Here you'll find some data science projects for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes.

Projects are presented in iPython Notebooks (.ipynb) and Python Scripts (.py), and written from the perspective of guiding the reader through a topic.

## Overview
- Data Science, at its core, is a field of study aimed at discovering insights from data through computer programming and mathematics.
- Naturally, this involves a combination of data engineering, analytics, statistics, algorithmic problem-solving, deductive & inductive reasoning, and incorporating domain expertise.
- With the ability to automatically, quickly and reliably classify information, predict outcomes, segment clusters of data points and more, data science has become increasingly integrated into all walks of life.
- Personally, my involvement with data science stems from a backgound in mathematics and physics, with focus on statistical analysis & visualization, and applying all of these through Python.
